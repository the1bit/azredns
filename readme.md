Dynamic DNS in Azure
===

# Background

This solution helps you to update your home server public IP dynamically. This is an alternative for NO-IP (where you have to confirm your host every 30 days). Here you don't need to confirm your host settings in a central surface.

This is not 100% free. The monthly cost in case of a "Pay-AS-YOU-GO" subscription is about **1 EUR/month**.


# Available platforms
